        <p>Proper fueling before, during, and after your marathon can make all the difference. Here’s a comprehensive guide to ensure your body has the energy it needs to perform at its best throughout the race.</p>

        <h3>Pre-Race Fueling</h3>
        <p>What you eat before the marathon is crucial. You’ll need to load up on carbohydrates to ensure your glycogen stores are full, but don’t overeat or try something new. Here’s what you should focus on:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Eat a carbohydrate-rich meal 3-4 hours before the race, such as pasta, oatmeal, or rice with lean protein.</li>
            <li>Stay hydrated, but avoid drinking too much right before the race.</li>
            <li>Avoid high-fat or high-fiber foods to prevent gastrointestinal issues during the race.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>During the Race</h3>
        <p>During the marathon, you’ll need to replenish your energy and stay hydrated. The goal is to maintain your glycogen stores and electrolytes. Here's what you should do:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Take in energy gels, chews, or drinks every 30-45 minutes to keep your energy levels up.</li>
            <li>Drink water or an electrolyte drink at every water station to stay hydrated.</li>
            <li>If possible, use a sports drink that also contains electrolytes to avoid cramping.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Post-Race Recovery</h3>
        <p>After crossing the finish line, your body needs to recover quickly, and proper nutrition is key. Aim to refuel as soon as possible with the right combination of carbs, protein, and fats:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Within 30 minutes of finishing, eat a snack that includes carbohydrates and protein (e.g., a smoothie or recovery bar).</li>
            <li>Stay hydrated and continue drinking fluids with electrolytes to replace what you've lost.</li>
            <li>In the hours following the race, focus on balanced meals that contain carbohydrates, protein, and healthy fats to aid muscle recovery.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>With the right fueling strategy, you’ll be able to maintain your energy levels throughout the race and recover effectively afterward. Remember, fueling isn’t just about what you eat; it’s about timing and consistency. Stick to a routine that works for your body, and you’ll be well on your way to marathon success!</p>
