            <p><strong>Running a race is as much about preparation as it is about performance. One of the key components of your preparation is fueling your body right. Here's how you can optimize your diet for maximum energy and performance.</strong></p>
            
            <h3>Before the Race: Fueling Up</h3>
            <p>What you eat before the race can significantly affect your performance. Ideally, your pre-race meal should be consumed 2-3 hours before the race and consist of easily digestible carbohydrates, moderate protein, and low fat. Some options include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Oatmeal with fruits</li>
                <li>Whole wheat toast with peanut butter and banana</li>
                <li>Rice and chicken</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These meals help maintain blood sugar levels while avoiding digestive discomfort during the race. Make sure to hydrate properly by drinking water or an electrolyte drink before the race begins.</p>
            
            <h3>During the Race: Staying Energized</h3>
            <p>During longer races (especially marathons or half marathons), your body’s glycogen stores deplete, and you may need to refuel. This can be done using:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Energy gels or chews</li>
                <li>Bananas</li>
                <li>Sports drinks</li>
            </ul>
            <p>It's important to drink water at regular intervals to stay hydrated, especially if you're running in warm weather. Sports drinks with electrolytes can help replace lost salts and prevent muscle cramps.</p>

            <h3>After the Race: Recovery Fuel</h3>
            <p>Post-race recovery is just as important as pre-race fueling. After a race, your body needs to repair muscles, replenish glycogen stores, and rehydrate. A great post-race meal should consist of:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Protein (to aid muscle repair): Chicken, fish, tofu, or a protein shake</li>
                <li>Carbohydrates (to replenish glycogen): Sweet potatoes, brown rice, or pasta</li>
                <li>Healthy fats (to reduce inflammation): Avocados, nuts, or olive oil</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Make sure to drink plenty of water to rehydrate and consider a sports recovery drink that contains both electrolytes and carbohydrates.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion: Your Diet Makes a Difference</h3>
            <p>Whether you are running a 5K or preparing for a marathon, paying attention to your diet can make a huge difference in your performance. By fueling up before the race, staying energized during, and recovering properly afterward, you'll set yourself up for success. Remember, everyone’s body is different, so experiment with foods that work best for you!</p>
