        <p>Running efficiently is crucial for improving performance and reducing the risk of injury. Here are five expert tips that can help runners of all levels enhance their form:</p>

        <h3>1. Maintain an Upright Posture</h3>
        <p>Keep your torso aligned and avoid leaning forward or backward while running. This will help reduce strain on your back and legs, allowing for a more fluid and efficient running style.</p>

        <h3>2. Engage Your Core</h3>
        <p>A strong core provides stability and helps in maintaining a proper posture throughout your run. Engaging your core muscles with each stride will help you avoid fatigue and improve your endurance over time.</p>

        <h3>3. Relax Your Hands and Shoulders</h3>
        <p>Tension in your hands and shoulders can waste energy and make your run less efficient. Relax your hands into a loose fist, and keep your shoulders down and away from your ears for a smoother stride.</p>

        <h3>4. Shorten Your Stride</h3>
        <p>Long strides can cause stress on your joints and increase the risk of injury. Instead, focus on shorter, quicker strides. This will help maintain momentum and reduce fatigue, especially in longer runs.</p>

        <h3>5. Proper Foot Strike</h3>
        <p>Landing mid-foot rather than striking with your heels or toes will allow for better shock absorption. This will reduce the impact on your knees and hips and help you run with more energy efficiency.</p>

        <p>By practicing these tips, you can significantly improve your running form, resulting in better performance, reduced injury risk, and an overall more enjoyable experience. Whether you're a beginner or a seasoned runner, these adjustments can make a big difference in your running journey.</p>
